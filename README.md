# IBD_subtype_discovery
I developed a novel proof-of-concept dual-encoder deep learning model to predict inflammatory bowel disease progression using longitudinal multi-omics data from 130 patients and over 1,600 samples. Using Gaussian mixture modeling on trajectory features, I identified three molecularly distinct Crohn’s disease subtypes and validated these findings with transcriptomic inflammation levels (p = 0.0017). Additionally, I discovered a high-risk subgroup representing 10% of patients with a 40% elevation in molecular inflammation, providing the potential for early treatment stratification and advancing precision medicine approaches in IBD. Future works including further cross-validation using more datasets, which would in turn enrich subtype results.
